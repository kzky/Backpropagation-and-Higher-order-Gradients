# Backpropagation-and-Higher-order-Gradients

This is the mathematical notes for computing the 1st-order gradients of functions and higher-order gradients.


See [PDF](./Backpropagation_and_Higher_order_Gradients_v0.8.pdf).


## Compile

If you want to compile by your self, just copy and paste the main.tex to Overleaf project, please.


## Contribution

If you kindly add new functions or correct some notations, please make a PR. It would be appriciated if you make PR for each modification like one PR for one function, one unit of corrections, or etc.


## TODO
- Reccurent layers
- The others than Reccurent layers
